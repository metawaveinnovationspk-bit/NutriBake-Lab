  abstract: 'NutriBake is a food science and technology project focused on developing functional bakery products for improved nutritional value and more informed dietary choices. The project addresses conventional bakery items that are high in refined flour, added sugar and sodium while lacking fiber and other essential nutrients. Its goal is to bridge food science with technology through functional recipe formulations and automated health recommendations for individuals managing diabetes or hypertension, as well as pediatric dietary needs. The methodology combines food science-based formulation with sensory evaluation, including comparison of taste, texture and flavor profiles, supported by a technology layer for product and recommendation management. The developed work includes functional bakery formulations such as Golden Crumb Cupcakes, Cocolina Cookies, and Nutri Balls, using nutrient-dense and therapeutic functional ingredients. The project also incorporates a web-based technology stack using HTML5, Vite, React, APIs, Laravel and MongoDB. Overall, NutriBake brings functional food formulation, sensory evaluation and digital recommendations together to support more health-conscious bakery choices.',
